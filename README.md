# 🏈 NFL Player Movement Prediction

This repository was created to store the learning process and predictions developed for an **[NFL competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2026-prediction/overview)** aimed at **predicting a player's next movements during a play**, based on previously provided information.

The project uses a **simple LSTM model**, fed with several features related to **position**, **acceleration**, **speed**, **direction**, and more. The RMSE was approximately 7 yards, meaning that, on average, the model misses a player's play by 7 yards. It's important to remember that a play can contain multiple moments; for our prediction, the maximum predicted was 30 points, equivalent to 3 seconds.

## 📊 Prediction Examples

Below are some images of the predictions generated by the model:

We can observe that the model shows **significant errors in specific scenarios**, such as when an **OLB likely rushes the passer** or in **blitz situations**, where the dynamics change abruptly and become harder to anticipate.

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

Some ideas and directions for improving the model include:

- **Normalize based on the football field**: Normalize considering the real geometry and dimensions of the field.
  
- **Average of the features of the play**: Use play-level feature averages to enrich contextual understanding.

- **A constant distance from the line of scrimmage indicates zone coverage**: Explore defensive coverage heuristics as additional features.

- **Human Trajectory (Geometric Baseline)**: Use human trajectory models as a geometric baseline.

- **Player momentum**: Incorporate physical momentum to better capture motion continuity and direction changes.
